# impactchart

`impactchart` is a Python library for generating impact charts.

In introduction to impact charts will soon be available in a blog 
post on [datapinions.com](https://datapinions.com).

Applications built on top of `impactchart` be found in the 
projects [evlcharts](https://github.com/vengroff/evlcharts) and
[rihcharts](https://github.com/vengroff/rihcharts).

An earlier version of the code that led to what is now available
here produced the impact charts available at [http://rih.datapinions.com/impact.html](http://rih.datapinions.com/impact.html).
This work, and the motivation for the impact chart approach, is discussed at length in the blog post
