`impactchart` is a Python library for generating impact charts.

Please see [An Introduction to Impact Charts](https://datapinions.com/an-introduction-to-impact-charts/)
for an introduction to what they are all about.

Applications built on top of `impactchart` be found in the 
projects [evlcharts](https://github.com/vengroff/evlcharts) and
[rihcharts](https://github.com/vengroff/rihcharts).

An earlier version of the code that led to what is now
here produced the impact charts available at [http://rih.datapinions.com/impact.html](http://rih.datapinions.com/impact.html).
This work, and the motivation for the impact chart approach, is discussed at length in the blog post
[Using Interpretable Machine Learning to Analyze Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Home Values](https://datapinions.com/using-interpretable-machine-learning-to-analyze-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in-home-values/).
